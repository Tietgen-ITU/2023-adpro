  /* Note 1. f can return without forcing the tail
   *
   * Note 2. this is not tail recursive (stack-safe) It uses a lot of stack if
   * f requires to go deeply into the lazy list. So folds sometimes may be less
   * useful than in the strict case
   *
   * Note 3. We added the type C to the signature. This allows to start with a
   * seed that is a subtype of what the folded operator returns.
   * This helps the type checker to infer types when the seed is a subtype, for 
   * instance, when we construct a list:
   *
   * o.foldRight (Nil) ((a,z) => a:: z)
   *
   * The above works with this generalized trick. Without the C generalization
   * the compiler infers B to be List[Nothing] (the type of Nil) and reports
   * a conflict with the operator.  Then we need to help it like that:
   *
   * o.foldRight[List[Int]] (Nil) ((a,z) => a:: z)
   *
   * With the C type trick, this is not neccessary. As it hints the type
   * checker to search for generalizations of B.
   *
   * I kept the foldLeft type below in a classic design, so that you can
   * appreciate the difference. Of course, the same trick could've been
   * applied to foldLeft.
